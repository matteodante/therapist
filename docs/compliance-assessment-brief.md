# External compliance assessment brief

**Prepared:** 2026-07-23  
**Project:** Therapist  
**Publisher:** Matteo Dante, acting as an individual  
**Requested reviewer:** qualified EU medical-device, AI Act, data-protection, and consumer-software
specialist

This brief supplies implementation facts and asks for written decisions. It is not a self-issued
legal opinion, conformity assessment, or compliance claim.

## Proposed release

Therapist is free, non-commercial, AGPL-3.0-or-later software for informed adult self-hosters. Its
claim is:

> An open-source AI agent for reflection, not code.

The mandatory limitation says it is experimental and not clinically validated; it is not therapy,
diagnosis, medical advice, emergency care, or human monitoring; output can be wrong; and the selected
provider and Telegram receive required content.

There is no PyPI release, SaaS, account system, paid support, advertising, telemetry, donation,
sponsorship, maintainer-operated inference, institutional deployment, or minor use in scope. Source
and installers are globally accessible through GitHub, so territorial reach requires explicit
analysis even though the intended release is narrow. Free distribution is not assumed to remove EU
AI Act or medical-device obligations; that conclusion is part of the requested review.

## Functional facts

- One adult uses one private local instance through a terminal or allowlisted Telegram bot.
- A generative model holds a natural conversation in Italian or English.
- The system creates an evidence-linked, correctable longitudinal formulation from user text.
- It stores complete messages, session summaries, facts, tentative hypotheses, focus, and
  intervention lifecycle locally in encrypted SQLite.
- It performs local semantic retrieval with a pinned Hugging Face embedding model.
- The user can inspect, confirm, correct, forget, export, and delete local state.
- It gives contextual possible-danger language and resource guidance but does not perform a clinical
  risk assessment, diagnosis, score, alert, human escalation, or emergency monitoring.
- The selected conversation model can be local Ollama or a separately selected remote provider.
  Supported setup choices currently include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, experimental
  personal ChatGPT Codex OAuth, and arbitrary PydanticAI model IDs.
- Telegram is optional and transports message content. The maintainer receives no normal application
  data.

The canonical product and architecture facts are in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), the claim boundary in
[claims-and-intended-purpose.md](claims-and-intended-purpose.md), and the flow in
[PRIVACY.md](../PRIVACY.md).

## Written decisions requested

### Medical-device and consumer-product status

1. Under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and MDCG 2019-11 rev.1, does this exact intended purpose and
   functionality qualify as medical-device software?
2. Which features or public wording would change that result, including mental-health monitoring,
   symptom scales, named conditions, intervention recommendations, or safety claims?
3. What obligations apply to free open-source distribution by an individual if the software remains
   outside the MDR?
4. Which EU and Italian consumer, product-safety, product-liability, accessibility, or professional
   practice rules still apply despite the non-commercial and experimental labels?

### EU AI Act

1. Is Matteo Dante a provider, deployer, distributor, importer, product manufacturer, or another
   actor for this composed open-source system?
2. Does the open-source exception affect any obligation for this release and, if so, exactly which
   conditions and exclusions apply?
3. Does Article 50(2) require machine-readable marking of terminal and Telegram replies, and which
   approved method is adequate?
4. Are the current first-interaction disclosures sufficient for Article 50(1)?
5. Do any prohibited-practice or high-risk classifications apply to the actual functionality or
   reasonably foreseeable use?

### GDPR and electronic communications

1. Map controller, joint-controller, processor, recipient, and independent-controller roles for the
   publisher, self-hoster, model providers, Telegram, GitHub, and Hugging Face.
2. State territorial scope and the limits of the personal-or-household exemption.
3. If the publisher is a controller, identify Article 6 and Article 9 conditions, transparency,
   retention, data-subject, security, breach, processor-contract, and recordkeeping duties.
4. Decide whether the screening in [dpia-screening.md](dpia-screening.md) requires a full DPIA and
   whether prior supervisory consultation is needed.
5. State the required international-transfer and subprocessor review for each supported provider.

### Provider and distribution terms

1. Confirm whether each advertised provider permits this mental-wellbeing-adjacent self-hosted use.
2. Determine whether personal ChatGPT Codex OAuth may lawfully be used by this non-coding agent and
   which compatibility claim, if any, may be published.
3. Identify notices, attribution, acceptable-use, age, geographic, or data-processing terms that
   must appear in setup or documentation.
4. Confirm whether GitHub source archives and copy-paste installers create additional publisher or
   product obligations.

## Requested deliverables

- a dated medical-device qualification and classification memorandum tied to the exact claim and
  commit;
- a dated AI Act actor/classification and Article 50 decision, including any implementation
  requirement and transition date;
- a GDPR role, legal-basis, Article 9, transfer, provider-contract, and DPIA decision;
- a provider-terms opinion covering all configurations advertised in the release;
- a short residual-risk and mandatory-change list suitable for the release record.

Every conclusion should identify assumptions, jurisdiction, source, effective date, reviewer, and
change triggers. A conclusion limited to one provider or deployment mode must not be generalized to
the others.
