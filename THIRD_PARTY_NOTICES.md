# Third-party notices

Therapist's original code, protocol text, documentation, and synthetic product screenshot are
licensed under `AGPL-3.0-or-later`. The items below remain under their owners' terms and are not
relicensed by Therapist.

## uv

When `uv` is absent, the bootstrap installers download the official uv 0.11.31 platform archive
directly from its immutable GitHub release. Therapist does not include or host the uv executable.
The archive and release checksum manifest are verified before installation.

Therapist selects uv's MIT license option, verifies its text from uv's pinned source commit, and
installs the complete verified license next to the downloaded executable as `uv-LICENSE-MIT`.

## Local embedding model

Setup downloads `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` at commit
`97b0c614be4d77ee51c0cef4e5f07c00f9eb65b3`. The model is not included in Therapist's wheel or
source distribution. Its official repository metadata identifies it as Apache-2.0, but the pinned
snapshot does not contain a `LICENSE` or `NOTICE` file. Do not mirror or redistribute the model as
part of Therapist without a separate licensing review.

## Python dependencies

Runtime dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`, resolved in `uv.lock`, and installed as
separate upstream distributions. They are not vendored into Therapist's wheel. Each retains its own
license and notices. A self-contained binary, container, offline environment, or mirrored package
set requires a new notice audit against the exact platform artifacts.

## WHO and NICE references

The protocol pack contains original project text plus bibliographic titles and links to official
WHO and NICE pages. It does not distribute their publications, scripts, images, logos, or copied
recommendation text. Those materials remain subject to the owners' terms. Do not add substantive
WHO or NICE content to prompts or distributable protocol files without a specific licensing review.
