# Governance

Therapist is currently a single-maintainer project. Matteo Dante is the project maintainer and has
final responsibility for scope, releases, security response, repository access, and protocol
changes.

The public alpha is published by Matteo Dante as an individual. It is free and non-commercial:
there is no company operator, hosted service, paid support, donation, or sponsorship program.

## Decisions

Small fixes may be accepted directly when they preserve the documented scope and pass the repository
checks. Discuss major behavioral, protocol, dependency, storage, security, licensing, or architecture
changes in an issue before implementation. Decisions prioritize:

1. user safety, privacy, and data integrity;
2. evidence-linked and correctable behavior;
3. the smallest maintainable implementation;
4. compatibility with the current single-user milestone.

The maintainer may reject changes that exceed the documented scope, add maintenance burden without a
current need, weaken validation or safety boundaries, or make unsupported clinical claims.

## Alpha governance constraints

For the current single-maintainer phase, changes are pushed directly to `main`; the repository does
not require a pull request or independent review. The maintainer must run the local release checks
before pushing and verify the resulting GitHub CI and CodeQL runs before tagging a release.

There is no second administrator, recovery owner, or confidential project-specific conduct inbox.
These are accepted alpha risks, not mature-project controls. The project must not claim independent
review, continuous availability, confidential conduct case handling, or succession coverage. These
decisions must be revisited before adding a second maintainer, accepting material operational
responsibility for users, or promoting beyond a controlled alpha.

## Contributions and succession

Contributors retain copyright in their work and certify contributions through the Developer
Certificate of Origin described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Project roles will be expanded
only when sustained contribution makes them real rather than aspirational.

If the maintainer can no longer maintain the project, they may appoint a successor, add co-maintainers,
or archive the repository with its status documented publicly. No current successor or recovery
owner is promised.
