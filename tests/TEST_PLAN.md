# Structured test plan

All people and transcripts are synthetic. Deterministic persistence, protocol, tool, privacy, and
transport contracts run without network access. Live provider role-play and semantic judging remain
opt-in regression aids; they are not clinical validation.

## Deterministic architecture contracts

- root protocol, skill bodies, references, and strict governance metadata load separately;
- hashes, missing files, unknown fields, duplicate IDs, invalid hashes, and path escape fail;
- the case envelope is valid bounded JSON in a separate message and never appears in instructions;
- persisted history excludes instructions, case envelopes, loaded skill bodies, rejected drafts, and
  provider thinking while retaining paired tool exchanges;
- an ordinary presence reply needs no skill or tool; at most one skill is loaded per turn;
- the output is non-empty, refers only to available IDs, rejects raw HTML/media, and stays within
  the 4,000-character cap;
- every write is staged and atomically committed only after valid output; retry cannot duplicate it.

## Memory and retrieval contracts

- user reports use exact quotes and `origin=user_statement` without implying external truth;
- hypotheses remain `origin=agent_hypothesis` for fits, partly fits, does not fit, and unsure;
- per-claim review evidence, replacement corrections, contradiction without replacement, explicit
  conflicts, forgetting, staleness, and formulation link/unlink rules are enforced;
- active context excludes superseded, archived, forgotten, and does-not-fit material;
- retrieval combines semantic/lexical relevance, recency, accepted focus, pending intervention,
  process preference, unwanted effect, support choice, conflict, relevant session, and excerpt;
- old relevant records beat recent distractors; multilingual meaning equivalents work; results stay
  bounded and valid JSON;
- vectors and payloads remain encrypted; missing embeddings fail closed.

## Privacy, retention, and clean break

- standard persists every encrypted layer;
- transcript-only persists transcript/history but exposes no structured write tools;
- ephemeral writes no file or persistent record;
- configured retention dry-run is non-mutating; apply propagates to derived state;
- session and date deletion propagate to messages, semantic entries, formulation, summaries,
  interventions, excerpts, and pending IDs;
- incompatible schema versions fail before use. No migration, legacy alias, or plaintext backup is
  implemented.

## Tool coverage

Deterministic harness tests exercise:

```text
load_therapeutic_skill
retrieve_case_context
record_user_reports
record_hypothesis
correct_claim
review_hypotheses
set_focus
record_process_feedback
record_intervention
record_support_choice
```

Tests cover invalid IDs/evidence, repeated and idempotent calls, cumulative turn invariants,
incompatible correction/review, update-in-place interventions, invalid transitions, tool traces,
export, failed runs, and no-tool presence.

## Conversational role-play dataset

`tests/cases/conversational_roleplays.yaml` contains original Italian and English multi-turn cases:

1. vague first disclosure;
2. wants only to be heard;
3. asks for practical help;
4. repeated short answers;
5. no homework;
6. competing concerns;
7. rejected formulation;
8. rejected advice;
9. failed behavioral experiment;
10. grounding increased panic;
11. return after months;
12. conversational preference correction;
13. conflicting memories;
14. corrected personal fact;
15. forgotten event;
16. wants another form of support;
17. barrier to support;
18. wants to stop;
19. old hypothesis no longer fits;
20. direct user-stated pattern.

Each live execution uses a fresh encrypted database, configurable repeat count, deterministic
assertions for state/tool contracts, and a semantic judge for observable listening, understandable
language, calibrated empathy, collaboration, autonomy, progressive formulation, functioning,
explanatory model, strengths/support, feedback, permission, one-intervention maximum, presence,
repair, unwanted-effect review, accurate continuity, non-generic support, and pressure-free closure.

The exportable human-review artifact contains scenario ID, locale, synthetic transcript, selected
skill, tool path, memory/formulation/intervention changes, deterministic assertions, semantic
evaluation, reviewer fields, and notes. It must never contain real user data.

## Commands

```bash
uv run pytest -m "not live"

THERA_RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1 OPENAI_API_KEY=... \
  uv run pytest -m live

THERA_RUN_CODEX_EVALS=1 \
  uv run pytest tests/test_live_codex_memory.py -m live

THERA_RUN_CODEX_SAFETY_EVALS=1 THERA_CODEX_SAFETY_EVAL_REPEAT=3 \
  uv run pytest tests/test_live_codex_safety.py -m live

THERA_RUN_CONVERSATION_EVALS=1 THERA_EVAL_MODEL=codex:gpt-5.6-sol \
  uv run pytest tests/test_live_conversational_roleplays.py -m live
```

`THERA_CONVERSATION_EVAL_CASES` optionally selects comma-separated scenario IDs for focused reruns.

Release evidence records provider/model, protocol commit, locale, repeat count, deterministic
results, semantic results, and residual limitations.
